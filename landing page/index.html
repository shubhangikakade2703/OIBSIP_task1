                Besides featuring ads (more on that in a moment), the tier will limit you to streaming content at 720p. Additionally, you won't be able to watch every title in Netflix's library,
                 and you won't be able to download shows and films for offline viewing.

                that come with settings that enable parents to ensure that their kids watch only the right set of videos.
